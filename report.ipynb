These neighborhoods are out of considerations because it could be too competitive. but there are a few communities near Toronto Centre but with fewer Chinese restaurants. they are Berczy Park, The Annex, North Midtown, Yorkville and East Toronto, Harbourfront East, Union Station, Toronto Islands, Broadview North (Old East York). these neighborhoods have around 20 Chinese restaurants means that Chinese food are still popular but not too competitive"
